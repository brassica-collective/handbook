Most approaches to constructing housing are contributing to the climate crisis. In response, there are a range of efforts to reduce the environmental impacts of housing, including agitating for legislative changes, demonstrating the feasibility of rural off-grid communities, ensuring that the new-apartments being built for higher-density living are constructed in sustainable ways, and living more collaboratively. For some detailed examples, see the case studies Anitra Nelson has offered to help demonstrate that ["small is necessary and, with sharing, feasible"](https://anitranelson.info/small-is-necessary-shared-living-on-a-shared-planet/). 

As part of this broader movement, we need to be using the housing stock that is already available. The construction of these houses consumed massive amounts of energy and water when built, so replacing them with new eco-builds may create more problems then it solves. Fortunately, there are compelling arguments that [retrofitting](https://architectureau.com/articles/deep-retrofit-for-more-accessible-equitable-and-resilient-houses/) suburban houses can offer some of the best bang-for-buck actions for reducing house-level climate emissions. This argument is supported by a range of examples of retrofitting houses in the temperate suburbs of Naarm, detailed by David Holmgren in [Retrosuburbia](https://retrosuburbia.com/). 

In the context of housing, retrofitting takes what already exists and revives it in response to the changing conditions, such as adapting our built environment and technologies to make them fit for new purposes. For example, double-glazing the windows, adding more insulation to an existing house, and increasing the space for gardening, are 'retrofits' that dramatically reduces the energy required to heat or cool the house. Given that most of this existing housing was constructed in ways that are not fit for the purpose of providing shelter from the (increasingly) extreme weather conditions, retrofitting also offers an avenue for improving the housing options of more people. For example, if done in consultation with existing communities, retrofitting existing suburban properties may also reduce the less risk of contributing to gentrification and displacement associated with expensive new builds. 

The potential impact of retrofitting existing suburban houses at scale can be illustrated by comparing it to the likely alternative that most suburban houses will be demolished and rebuilt (because it generates more profit for developers). In a small number of cases, this may be a good thing - especially if it can help us increase our housing-density by creating more environmentally sustainable  that support more people to live in smaller personal spaces by sharing more of the resources needed to meet collective needs.  

Unfortunately, the most likely replacement build for most suburban houses will be a small collection of single-family townhouses. While this may help increase the suburban block occupancy from the ~3 people in the stand-alone house to ~10 people across 4 town-houses, the expectation that each town-house is self-contained has significant environmental impacts. For example, most townhouses pave the land to provide each dwelling their own garage off the shared driveway. This paving is likely to have multiple negative impacts: paving reduces ground water absorption which can increase the severity of flash floods; paving increases the urban heat-island effect by replacing tree-cover; and paving reduces space for gardening which might otherwise have contributed to networks of urban food security. 

Rather than duplicate facilities for every household, the RAD housing approach encourages sharing key resources in ways that reduces the space required to increase occupancy. For instance, in addition to the baseline retrofits, RAD housing encourages adding additional living spaces to the main house during the retrofit stage and building a secondary dwelling on the property. This approach can increase the occupancy from the ~3 people of a typical household to 8-10 people across 2 dwellings that are built to maximise the land available for gardening and support a range of different approaches to living collectively.
