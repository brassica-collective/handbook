The RAD housing project offers one small way to contribute to prefiguring better futures by providing opportunities to live collectively in ways that help us to practice commoning by embracing unexpected outcomes of our participatory processes as they emerge from the collective efforts of those who show up.

## Relational Scaffolding
The Transition to Stewardship model is a tool for redirecting pooled financial resources towards collectively stewarding climate resilient housing.

This model relies on the cost savings that can be unlocked by multiple people living together in higher-density than suburban expectations. It may also provide other benefits, including helping to lower consumption, reduce waste, combat isolation, and be more intentional with our acts of solidarity. However, these benefits do not necessarily follow from simply living in proximity with each other. 

To live together in ways that generate collective well-being, we need to actively build the distributed networks of relationships within which we can take care of one another and our environments.This effort includes everything from the administrative hurdles of participating in decision-making processes to the psychosocial unlearning required to navigate conflict well within emergent group dynamics. 
 
There is also relational effort involved in managing the project of acquiring, retrofitting, and maintaining the infrastructure needed for collaborative housing. It can be difficult to balance establishing good group processes with effective project-management, and there are many different approaches. 

For instance, some approaches are group-first - carefully building the relational scaffolding needed to live collectively before slowly co-creating the physical infrastructure to house the group along the way. This has led to many thriving intentional communities, however it relies on those with capacity to dive all-in on a journey with an unclear direction or exit pathway. Other approaches also begin by forming a group with shared values and taking the time to build relationships, yet focus on co-creating a clear vision and project-plan for their intended ‘forever homes’, before living together. These approaches have also had many successes, yet groups often spend years visioning before beginning to live together.
There are also some projects that pre-envision sharable infrastructure while relying on collaboration between residents to emerge once already living across shared spaces. 

## Project-Group Balance
Building on patterns that have been established through existing collective projects, RAD housing outlines a transitional processes for acquiring and retrofitting houses for collective stewardship in ways that are able to emerge differently depending on the local context. 

Each implemention of this transitional process needs to find a sustainable balance between efforts to drive the project forward and relational practices that allow the emergent group dynamics of those who show-up and participate to change the project along the way.

To navigate this balance collectively, we each need to avoid the temptation to hold tightly to our own visions of the project and instead focus on building relationships that allow for genuine participation in the co-creation processes of commoning. 

## Commoning 
Building on the noun of ‘commons’ for those spaces that are collectively stewarded for the benefit of all participants, the verb commoning draws attention to the dynamic actions involved in participating in continually re-creating these spaces together.

Practising commoning also helps us shift away from treating common spaces as predefined containers for specific types of pre-determined relations. Releasing these pre-determined expectations, we can shift towards a view of commons as emerging from dynamic systems of relations that continually re-create collectively stewarded spaces. 

This process of commoning offers a way to practice how we relate to each other across our differences, and a way to contribute to changing structures by changing ourselves. In the context of RAD housing, creating explicit process that support us to practice commoning offers one way to balance emergent group-project dynamics. 

## Swarming on the Retrofit
One example of an explicit process for balancing emergent group-project dynamics is built into the transition-to-stewardship model process for ‘swarming’ on the retrofit stage of each property within a multi-house collective. 

This notion of ‘swarming’ includes the expectation that more people will contribute to acquiring and retrofitting each house than will eventually live in that specific house. The more participants able to swarm on each house, the sooner the collective is able to afford an additional house to put into the retrofitting and decommodifying pipeline - ensuring that all participants are able to be directly housed eventually. For example, if a group of 18 people ‘swarm’ their collective efforts to acquire a 3-bedroom property and retrofit it into one with 8 bedrooms across two dwellings, less than half the group will be housed there once established. However, as more properties are retrofitted this creates 12 dwelling of established housing across 5 properties – more than enough for the initial 18 people plus the additional ~30 participants who joined later on in the project.


To implement this ‘swarming’ approach, each collective will need explicit processes for deciding which participants are prioritised as residents when rooms in ‘established properties’ become available. These prioritising critiea should not be tied to financial or labour contributions. For example, to ensure that housing-access is not limited to those able to live in a building site, the set of folk who end up living in each established house should not default to those who choose to live there during the retrofit stage. 

## Multi-property collectives
Another way in which RAD housing requires a balance in emergent group-project dynamics is in the ways participants are expected to collectively steward a range of different retrofitted house configurations across multiple properties.    

By having multiple properties with different features, participants can self-organise into compatible co-living arrangements that can be re-considered as housing needs change over time. For example, while some participants may choose to live on a property that is structurally and relationally tailored for hosting community gatherings at one point in their life, at another point they may seek out the relative calm of a property that prioritises sensory-sensitive friendly spaces (or vice versa).  

In this context, the practice of navigating the emerging relational dynamics is crucial for both within-house collective living, and across-property practices of stewarding these houses for broader benefit. Given this, we expect it will be important to cap each collective at a size that supports high-trust relationships while allowing flexibility in living arrangements (<50 people). To pay-it-forward, any more-established collectives can support emerging projects seeking to retrofit and decommodify more housing. This approach also allows for the possibility several RAD housing collectives may emerge with distinct directions that can, in turn, help to cultivate dynamics that support the project-group balance of each collective. 

## Participating in living collectively
Another key aspect of the emerging relational dynamics in multi-property collectives is navigating the different decision-making processes needed within and across houses. This includes an appreciation that some decisions impact multiple housing sites, while others only impact one property, or a single house, or even one of the various spaces within a house. Each of these decision types may also differ depending on the relevant streams within the process of transitioning to stewardship. Other factors include how often agreements need to be reviewed to ensure shared expectations can change as new perspectives emerge.

The options for how we make decisions together are embedded within the broader governance practices that structure our relationships. Within colonial contexts, capitalism pressures us to default to ways of relating that perpetuate broader oppressive structures. To resist this, we need to get better at exploring, calibrating, and articulating shared expectations around each aspect of participation in collective practices. 

Therefore, instead of prescribing a specific approach to making decisions, RAD housing collectives are expected to co-create their own processes for determining who makes what decisions, when.  

At the same time, processes for co-creating collective practices need not be built from scratch. There are many existing resources for supporting such practices, and lessons from housing collectives implementing the RAD housing approach are likely to be shared openly for other to adapt for their own contexts. 

It is through intentional approaches to living collectively that RAD housing projects offer pathways towards supporting broader efforts to decommodify our basic needs, decolonise our ways of relating, and act in solidarity with more radical movements for justice.
