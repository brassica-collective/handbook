To [decommodify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decommodification) housing is to stop treating it as a commodity. A “commodity” has an exchange value, meaning that a commodity can be traded for other commodities, giving its owner the benefit of others' labour.

...more details on what local effort towards decommodifying housing can look like in practice, please see slides from the RAD workshop in the meantime.
