We expect multiple crews of various types to form during the Brassica RAD Housing project. 

The following are examples of three types of crew and two specific crew, to illustrate the idea.

## Governance crews
Governance type of Crews are those focused on planning the project, design, and facilitation practices.

The RAD Crew will be our first governance crew, and is taking responsibility for designing and facilitating group-processes, refining the T2S model, and 
supporting our Collective to stay aligned with the RAD housing goals.  

## Implementation crews
Implementation types of Crew are those focused on the project management tasks required to implement specific stages of the project, such as acquiring properties, retrofitting, etc., 

The Seedling Crew will be our first implementation crew and will take responsibility for project-managing the first 'Seedling House' stage of the Brassica project. This would include tasks such as proposing property-selection criteria, and project managing house retrofits, etc.,  

## Optimisation crews
Optimisation crews are expected to form much later; once we've some established sites available for long-term habitation. Responsibilities might include things such as navigating the practical details of living in a multi-house collective, site maintenance, etc.,
