The Brassica Collective coheres around a specific implementation of a RAD Housing project based on the work of dynamic emerging group of participants who are experimenting with [commoning practices](https://commonslibrary.org/practising-commoning/) as part of a broader [prefigurative politics](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/) theory of change. 

Within this context, we expect the specific participatory decision-making processes we adopt to be co-created be those involved. 

As a starting point, we are differentiating between 'Voyagers' who participate in collective decision-making practices, and 'Supporters' who who are not interested in participating in decision-making for the foreseeable future, yet may be interested in the future (e.g., as residents in established Brassica houses) and/or want to support the role of Brassica Collective in contributing to RAD goals more generally.
