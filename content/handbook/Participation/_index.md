The Brassica Collective coheres around a specific implementation of a RAD Housing project by an emerging group of participants experimenting with [commoning practices](https://commonslibrary.org/practising-commoning/), as part of a broader [prefigurative politics](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/) theory of change. 

Within this context, we expect the specific participatory decision-making processes we adopt to be co-created by those involved. 

As a starting point, we are differentiating between ['Voyagers'](/handbook/participation/voyagers/) who participate in collective decision-making practices, and ['Supporters'](/handbook/participation/supporters/) who are not currently interested in participating in decision-making yet want to support the Brassica Collective in contributing to RAD goals.
