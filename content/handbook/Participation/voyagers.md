A form of participation for those who can commit to cultivating high-trust relationships and contributing to specific decisions about process-design proposals and project implementation. 

Minimum expectations for Voyagers is that they engage when prompted by Crew. 

In practice we expect this to involve regularly participating in facilitated assemblies in ~ 6 weekly rhythm where we discuss upcoming decisions, do some relationship-building exercises, hear report-backs from crew - and create opportunities to join and/or form new Crew

Additionally, being a Voyager will involve engaging with explicit requests to participate in online processes for making asynchronous decisions.

Some Voyagers may also opt-in to participate in one or more [Crew](/handbook/participation/02_crew/) to take on the additional responsibilities of directing specific aspects of the project (with guidance from the Brassica Collective at key decision points). 

There will also be a process for Voyagers to explicitly opt-out of decision-making responsibilities for short-periods of time.
