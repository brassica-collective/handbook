While the specific participatory decision-making processes we adopt for the Brassica Collective will need to be co-created be those involved, we are starting out with an initial set of participation forms: 


## Decision-making participation

### Voyagers
A form of participation for those who can commit to cultivating high-trust relationships and contributing to specific decisions about process-design proposals and project implementation 

#### Crew
An additional form of participation for Voyages who can commit to specific activities, such as designing governance processes and managing specific stages of the project. This is intended to consist of a changing sub-set of Voyages who have capacity to commit to regular ongoing contributions to specific aspects of the project (with guidance from the Brassica Collective at key decision points).


## Supporters (
Additionally, we are including an additional Supporter option for folk who are not interested in participating in decision-making responsibilities for the foreseeable future, yet may be interested in the future.
