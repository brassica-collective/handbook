Supporters are those who are interested in the project generally but not wanting to participate in decision-making processes about the specifics.

This includes, 
 * Folk who are want to participate in decision-making in the future (e.g., as residents in established Brassica houses) but are happy to be hands-off about how we get the houses and/or are not able to commit to reliably participating as a Voyager right now.
 * People with no intention of being ever being Voyagers, yet value the role of Brassica Collective in contributing to RAD goals and want to support in ad-hoc ways such as offering us your knowledge/expertise on aspects of the project, putting in bread-labour by coming to working bees, contributing funds etc.

Minimum expectations for Supports are: 
* Expressing interest in the project while explicitly opting-out of decision-making processes (for now)
* Engaging with specific support requests from Crew; opting-in or out depending on capacity at the time.
* Reaching out to express interested if/when waiting to contribute to decision-making processes
