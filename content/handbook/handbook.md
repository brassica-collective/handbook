This handbook aims to collect stable versions of documentation for the Brassica Collective.  

Initial sets of documentation includes:
  * Proposed forms of [participation](/handbook/participation/) for launching the Brassica Collective 
  * The goals of [retrofitting and decomodifying (RAD) housing](/handbook/rad-housing/) informing the formation of the Brassica Collective 
  * A draft [T2S Model](/handbook/t2s-model/) the RAD Crew is developing to help us navigate the financial/legal hurdles to collectively stewarding property

This handbook is currently maintained by the [RAD Crew](/handbook/participation/crew/). We aim to include a transparent process for determining when and how to update key documents in this handbook as part of the initial governance processes proposed for the Brassica Collective. If you'd like to get involved in maintaining these documents in the meantime, please contact us at crew@radhousing.org 

The Brassica Collective gathers on the unceded lands of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people of the Kulin Nation. We pay respect to past, present, and emerging Elders and honour their enduring connections to Country. We recognise the importance of their leadership, and the leadership of First Nations peoples across the world, in cultivating knowledge and practices that sustain collective efforts to prefigure better futures.
