This handbook aims to collect stable versions of documentation for the Brassica Collective.  

Initial sets of documentation includes:
  * Proposed forms of [participation](/handbook/participation/) for launching the Brassica Collective 
  * The goals of [retrofitting and decomodifying (RAD) housing](/handbook/rad-housing/) informing the formation of the Brassica Collective 
  * A draft [T2S Model](/handbook/t2s-model/) the RAD Crew is developing to help us navigate the financial/legal hurdles to collectively stewarding property

Note: This handbook is currently maintained by the [RAD Crew](/handbook/participation/crew/). We aim to include a transparent process for updating this handbook as part of the initial governance processes proposed for the Brassica Collective. If you'd like to get involved in maintaining/updating these documents in the meantime, please contact us at crew@radhousing.org
