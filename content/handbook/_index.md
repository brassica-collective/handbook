This handbook aims to collect stable versions of documentation for the Brassica Collective.

Initial sets of documentation includes:
  * Proposed forms of [participation](/handbook/participation/) for launching the Brassica Collective
  * The goals of [retrofitting and decomodifying (RAD) housing](/handbook/rad-housing/) informing the formation of the Brassica Collective
  * A draft [T2S Model](/handbook/t2s-model/) the RAD Crew is developing to help us navigate the financial/legal hurdles to collectively stewarding property

This handbook is currently maintained by the [RAD Crew](/handbook/participation/crew/). We aim to include a transparent process for determining when and how to update key documents in this handbook as part of the initial governance processes proposed for the Brassica Collective. If you'd like to get involved in maintaining these documents in the meantime, please contact us at crew@radhousing.org

This handbook is being maintained for an emerging Brassica Collective that gathers on the unceded lands of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people of the Kulin Nation. We honour their enduring connections to Country, and pay respect to Elders past and present. We acknowledge the ongoing impacts of colonisation, and recognise the importance of First Nations leadership in cultivating sustainable collective practices.
