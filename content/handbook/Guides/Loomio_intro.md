## Loomio Facilitation Guide

Loomio is a discussion forum that includes a set of templates specifically designed to collaborative groups to make better  decisions together. 

Good collaborative decisions almost always benefit from someone facilitating processes, and Loomio offers [guidelines](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/getting_started/decisions/index.html) for a range of different approaches. 

Some general facilitation tips include: 

  * When starting a new Thread include an introduction to the intended topic of discussion as well as any context-setting information needed for everyone in the group to understand the purpose of the discussion and meaningfully participate.  
  * During the discussion, there are various tools for helping to create space to explore and test ideas, encourage people to share from their different perspectives, explore converging and diverging view points, and summarise key points as they emerge. For example, for topics that prompt multiple discussion points, consider updating the thread *context section* with a summary of the key points as they emerge.  
  * When discussion reach a decision-point, the 'sense check' poll can be used to help surface concerns before moving to a formal proposal. You can find out if people are happy with where this is going, if they have questions or need more time for discussion.
  * To move the discussion towards a decision outcome, it is important to raise a formal proposal 
  * Following a formal proposal, it is important to advice participants of the proposal outcome.
