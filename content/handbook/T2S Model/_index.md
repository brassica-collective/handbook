## Transition to Stewardship (T2S) Housing Model 

There are [many approaches](https://www.collaborativehousing.org.au/copy-of-gather-a-community) to housing in more collaborative ways, each with [different sets of benefits and challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgmj_wp9EOs) that make them more or less appropriate depending on the context. The model outlined here intends to draw on lessons emerging from the more well-tested of these approaches to articulate an additional avenue for collaborating on housing. This avenue offers another option for small groups of people committed to the high-trust work of collectively stewarding the use of housing and associated land; it is not appropriate for those interested in individual ownership of property.
