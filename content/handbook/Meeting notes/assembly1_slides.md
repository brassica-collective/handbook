## Speaking Notes
### Acknowledgement of country 

### Introdution 

So I'd like to beign with a circle around the room so everyone has a chance to introduce themselves and settle into the space a bit.

There will be more oppourtinties to talk with each other later, for now please just share:  
- names / pronouns / and what land you're arriving from.
- And, complete the sentence "One characteristic of my vision of a better future is...."
[ACTIVITY]
Thank you all for sharing. Now I'd like to run through what you can expect for our time together today.
