We will need to make a lot of decisions together. 

To create a participatory decision-making process we will need to agree on how and when different types of decisions are made by whom. This will take time. It may also be useful to experiment with some different decision-making processes first.

Adopting an interim processes for making some initial decisions is intended to help us make initial decisions together while cultivating a shared context from which to co-create more appropriate decision-making processes for the each of the many types of decisions we hope to make together.

For this purpose, we are differentiating between two broad types of decisions: 'major' decisions about how we form our collective and 'minor' operational decisions needed to start implementing the RAD Housing goals for our collective.

As outlined in the interim process, our approach to making both of these types of decisions will include time within our assemblies for discussing up-coming decisions and engaging with discussion in an online tool - ['Loomio'](handbook/content/handbook/Guides/Loomio_intro.md) - that is designed to support decentralised groups to make decisions transparently. 


## About Loomio 

Loomio is a discussion forum that includes a set of templates specifically designed to collaborative groups to make better  decisions together. 

General commenting tips are similar to most forums:

  * You can reply to someone's comment by clicking on the reply icon located at the bottom right of the comment.

  * Use @mention to notify people.

Good collaborative decisions almost always benefit from someone facilitating processes, and Loomio offers [guidelines](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/getting_started/decisions/index.html) for a range of different approaches. Some general facilitation tips include: 

 * When starting a new Thread include an introduction to the intended topic of discussion as well as any context-setting information needed for everyone in the group to understand the purpose of the discussion and meaningfully participate.

 * During the discussion, there are various tools for helping to create space to explore and test ideas, encourage people to share from their different perspectives, explore converging and diverging view points, and summarise key points as they emerge. For example, for topics that prompt multiple discussion points, consider updating the thread context section with a summary of the key points as they emerge.

 * When discussion reach a decision-point, the 'sense check' poll can be used to help surface concerns before moving to a formal proposal. You can find out if people are happy with where this is going, if they have questions or need more time for discussion.

 * To move the discussion towards a decision outcome, it is important to raise a formal proposal

 * Following a formal proposal, it is important to advice participants of the proposal outcome.
