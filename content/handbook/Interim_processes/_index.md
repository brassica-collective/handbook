We will need to make a lot of decisions together. 

To create a participatory decision-making process we will need to agree on how and when [different types of decisions](/handbook/t2s-model/governance_practices/) are made by whom. This will take time. It may also be useful to experiment with some different decision-making processes first.

Adopting an interim processes is intended to help us make initial decisions together while cultivating a shared context from which to co-create more appropriate agreements for the each of the many types of decisions we hope to make together. 

In the meantime, we are differentiating between two broad types of decisions: 'major' decisions about how we form our collective and 'minor' operational decisions needed to start implementing the RAD Housing goals for our collective. As outlined in the [interim decision-making process](/handbook/Interim_processes/decision_making_process), our approach to making both of these types of decisions will include time within our assemblies for discussing up-coming decisions and engaging with discussion in an online tool - ['Loomio'](handbook/content/handbook/Guides/Loomio_intro.md) - that is designed to support decentralised groups to make decisions transparently. 

Likewise, we are initiating an initial [assembly facilitation guide](/handbook/Interim_processes/assembly_facilitation) that we can build upon together as we each take turns facilitating our gatherings.
