The following is an example of an assembly process to use as templates for structuring our assemblies. These are intended to provide us we a clear structure that helps us each take turns facilitating assemblies. We can add to this with more examples as we go and build on the structure as we co-create our agreements and processes.  

### Example 1:
 * Acknowledgement of Country  
 * Opening circle 
 * Crew report-backs  
 * Peer Q&A  
 * Rest break
 * Discussion of upcoming decisions on Loomio  
 * Activities in small groups  
 * Re-formation of crews
 * Closing circle
