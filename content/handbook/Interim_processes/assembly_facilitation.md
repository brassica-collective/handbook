Lessons from decentralised organising emphasise the value of cultivating processes for collaborating that are both clear and flexible. As this group grows, our way of being in assembly will need to be a bit different from a normal conversation, in order to ensure that we give room for everyone's voices, and create safer spaces for difficult conversations. 

One of the well-established facilitation tools for creating such spaces is to adopt a structured 'container' that starts with an opening circle to signal our move into this deliberate collaborative space and ends with closing circle that will bring us back to more familiar ways of conversing

For our initial assemblies, we are adopting an initial structured container to support as all to take turns co-facilitating assemblies. 

## Facilitation Container

Opening circle 20 min
 * Acknowledgement of Country  
 * Statement of intent
 * Arriving ritual
 * Arriving circle prompt
Meeting Agenda ~1.5hrs 
 * The specific details and order of 'meeting business' on our agenda will change, as the examples below illustrate, yet we hope to cultivate a rhythm that allows for  time for Crews to report their updates to the broader collective, time to discuss upcoming decisions, an opportunity to form/join/leave crews, and an activity to help us to build skills relating well together and practice navigating conflict productively. This is long, facilitators may want to add a break and/or an energy-raising activity.
Closing circle 15 min
 * Set date/time for next Assembly   
 * Call for co-facilitator for next Assembly 
 * Call for cook for the next assembly 
 * Leaving circle prompt
 * Closing ritual  

As we co-create our agreements and processes, we can also adjust these Assembly guidelines and add more examples.
