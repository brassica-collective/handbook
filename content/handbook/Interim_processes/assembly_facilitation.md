Lessons from decentralised organising emphasise the value of cultivating processes that are both clear and flexible. For our initial assemblies, there are some key elements (in addition to standard meeting processes) we hope to cultivate: an opening circle, time for Crews to report their updates to the broader collective, discussion of any upcoming decisions, an opportunity to form/join/leave crews, an activity to help us practice relating well together, and a closing circle. 

The following are two examples of ways of structuring these elements. These are intended to be adapted as we can us each take turns facilitating assemblies and, as we co-create our agreements and processes, as can also can adjust these and add more examples.

### Example 1:
 * Acknowledgement of Country  
 * Opening circle 
 * Crew report-backs & peer Q&A  
 * Discussion of upcoming decisions 
 * Rest break
 * Small group activity (e.g., collaborative design)
 * Re-formation of crews
 * Closing circle  

### Example 2:
 * Acknowledgement of Country  
 * Opening circle 
 * Crew report-backs & peer Q&A  
 * Full group activity (e.g., exploring the [critical uncertainties](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/30-critical-uncertainties/) of our project)
 * Rest break
 * Discussion of upcoming decisions 
 * Re-formation of crews
 * Closing circle
