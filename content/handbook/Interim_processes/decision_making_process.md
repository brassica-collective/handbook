The process outlined below is intended to be replaced by decision-making *agreements* once we have created them (and should be reviewed in October, if not already replaced by then). 

## Key Concepts
Before outlining the process, it is worth clarifying that this process is drawing on a few key concepts that are used differently in other contexts. The following descriptions of these concepts is intended to provide a pathway   

MAJOR DECISIONS: Major decisions are those that have high risk and/or permanent outcomes. Initially, our major decisions will be about how we function as a collective, including the principles informing our collective practices and how we make different types of decisions together. Major decisions we will face later (and hope to have an updated decision making process for) include articulating our criteria for determining membership rights and responsibilities, our processes for navigating conflict well together, when and how to acquire property, co-living and multi-site collectivising agreements, etc.,

MINOR DECISIONS: Minor decisions are those with low-risk and easily-reversible outcomes. For now, we are using this for all operational decisions needed to keep the project moving forward. Examples of operational decisions include selecting professionals who can review our T2S model, choosing a location for hosting our next assembly, prioritising the next tasks needed to move the project forward, selecting a process for documenting our decisions, etc.,   

CONSENSUS DECISION-MAKING: forming a *consensus* is a way of reaching agreement by  by discussing all opinions, ideas and concerns and collaborating to find solutions that everyone involved actively support, or are at least willing to agree to. There are many ways of forming consensus agreements, with different degrees of structure and formality as appropriate to the group. The key to making consensus work is for everyone to express their needs and viewpoints clearly, and for the group to use this information to find a solution which resolves differences enough to build on common ground. A consensus process typically follow some variation of the following stages: introduction; clarification; open discussion (focusing on expressing different perspectives); exploration (focusing on potential solutions); proposal; amendments; agreement-test; and implementation. It is important to remember that consensus agreements function best when everyone shares a common goal and are willing to work together towards it. Finding a solution usually relies on people being flexible about their preferences in order to meet all the cores needs. This requires a lot of trust. For examples of different consensus decision making processes, see those used by [Seeds of Change](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus#flowchart), [[Friends of the Earth Australia](https://www.foe.org.au/consensus_decision_making), and [as articulated in 'Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making' by Tim Hartnett (2011)](https://www.consensusdecisionmaking.org/).

CONSENT DECISION-MAKING: establishing [*consent*] is similar to forming a consensus agreement however, instead of seeking the best decision for the group, consent is established by the absence of objections, on the premise that everyone impacted is able to make principled objections and, if there are no objections, everyone can live with the decision even if it isn't an ideal outcome. Therefore, rather then aiming to resolve all concerns as would be required for consensus, a consent proposal is only amended for “principled objections” (such as “I think there is a serious risk this proposal could do harm”, not “I don’t like it”). While there are many ways of establishing consent, the stages of reaching consent agreements typically includes some version of the following steps:  proposal; questions: reactions; amendments; confirmation; implementation. This approach is not appropriate in all contexts, but does provide a transparent way to make low-risk time-sensitive decisions within decentralised groups. For examples of different ways consent decision-making is being conceptualised, see this account of how [consent differs from consensus decision-making](https://circleforward.us/what-is-the-difference-between-consent-and-consensus/), and the [consent principle as used in Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/consent-decision-making/).

There are a range of related concepts relevant to forming longer-term decisions which we'll explore together later. For example, see are The Hums's outline of [4 different forms of decision-making](https://www.thehum.org/post/decision-making-methods-for-decentralised-teams), including decisions made via consensus or consent, as well as those decisions made under 'advice', and decisions made by those with a delegated 'mandate'.

## Interim Consensus Process for Major Decisions
Initially, our major decisions will be about how we function as a collective, including the principles informing our collective practices and how we make different types of decisions together. 

While there are many ways of forming agreement by consensus, to start us off we are adopting a 4-stage version: 

1. INTRODUCTION, OPEN DISCUSSION, & EXPLORATION:   
A facilitator starts a thread on Loomio, introducing an upcoming decision-point for the collective and open a question round discussion to clarify any points, express different perspectives, and explore potential pathways forward. If an Assembly occurs during this time, the topic will be included on the agenda for some in-person discussion.
2. PROPOSAL & AMENDMENTS:   
Following discussion, the facilitator will make a proposal and run a sense check (e.g., a [gradients-of-agreement poll](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/proposals/index.html#gradients-of-agreement)) to encourage discussion of any concerns. If an Assembly occurs during this time, the topic will be included on the agenda for some in-person sense-making. The facilitator can amend the proposal as needed and run another sense-check.
3. AGREEMENT-TEST   
When the proposal is stable, the facilitator will start a formal ['consensus proposal'](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/proposals/index.html#consensus-proposal) on Loomio to test for agreement. Note that those who choose to [block](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus#block) agreement at this stage will be expected to take responsibility for updating the proposal and facilitating a new round of decision-making. 
4. IMPLEMENTATION:  
The facilitator summarises the outcome and initiate any steps required for implementation (e.g., updating the handbook)


## Interim Consent Process for Minor Decisions
Minor decisions are those with low-risk and easily-reversible outcomes. Examples of minor decisions include selecting professionals who can review our T2S model, choosing a location for hosting our next assembly, prioritising the next tasks needed to move the project forward, selecting a process for documenting our decisions, etc.,   

Our interim process for making minor decisions is to delegate decisions types to a crew through a *consent* process. In this context, *consent* is similar to consensus, but instead of seeking the best decision for the group, consent is the absence of objections ('I can live with this decisions'). Rather then aiming to resolve all concerns, the proposal is only amended for 'principled objections' (such as “I think there is a serious risk this proposal could do harm”, not “I don’t like it”). 

While there are many ways of forming agreement via consent, we will follow a simplified process (until we have a chance to collaborate on a more nuanced one). The steps in this process are:

1. PROPOSAL & QUESTIONS: As part of the crew report-back during the assembly, a crew will identify types of decision needed to move the project forward and invites clarification questions.  
2. REACTIONS: Following clarifications, the facilitator runs an in-person [sense check poll](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/proposals/index.html#sense-check) to test for reactions. 
3. AMENDMENTS: Those with concerns are able to suggest specific constructive modifications to the proposal for further discussion.  
4. CONFIRMATION: The crew can then post a formal ['Consent proposal'](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/proposals/index.html#consent-proposal) on Loomio (adding any amendment) 
5. IMPLEMENTATION: The facilitor then closes the proposal and summarises the outcome on Loomio for documentation.
 
In between Assemblies, crew can also seek [*advice*](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/advice_process/index.html) from Voyagers to increase the range of perspectives informing the decisions that have been delegated to them
