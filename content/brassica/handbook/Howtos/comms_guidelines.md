We’re a project driven by a fluctuating set of participants withing a dynamic organising structure. This only works because we operat in a high-communication environment.

Different tools are useful for different forms of communication. The following offers an overview of which tools we use for key communication forms within the collective.

## Opting in/out of different forms of participation = RADicalise  
The RADicalise tool allow participants to update your [intentions](https://brassica.radhousing.org/), opting in or out of different forms of participation each interval as relevant. 

## Instant Messaging = Matrix 
We use [Matrix](https://matrix.org/try-matrix/) as our tool for day-to-day real-time chat. (We get support for setting up Matrix from Merri-bek Tech, and you will be provided with an support to set up as part of the onboarding process.) 

Within the Brassica Matrix Space we have several rooms:

#### *Brassica Project* 
This is the ‘announcements’ channel. Crew use it for meeting announcements, decisions updates, calls to action, and in Loomio threads that need attention to drive the Brassica Collective's RAD project forward. While Loomio is for focused discussion and decisions, this space is good to draw people's attention to items needing action 

#### *Brassica Chat* 
This is our ‘chat’ channel where participants are welcome to share any social chatter (to keep the "Brassica Project" channel clearer for calls to action). You are welcome to ‘dip into’ this chat when you’re feeling social and mute/ignore it otherwise.

### *Crew channels* 
We also have a channel for each of our crew to organise, mostly we use it to talk about our work while we're working on it. So while you’re not actively participating on a given crew you can mute it.  
You can send direct messages to anyone, which is great if you’ve just got a quick question that you want an immediate answer to..

## Collaboration Tools 

### Strategic Roadmap

### Focused Discussion and Decision Making = Loomio 
Loomio is our tool for decision making and thoughtful discussions. 

Posting on Loomio won't necessarily alert everyone. An email notifications will be sent of if you invite people to a thread or poll. To allow for different modes of interactions, consider announcing a 'call to action' in the Brassica Project Matrix chat. 

Subgroups on Loomio are used to collect related sets of closed-threads that may need to be reviewed. For example, we have subgroups for 'Agreement proposals' and 'Meeting minutes'.   

### Current Agreements and Processes = Handbook

### Draft Agreements and Processes = Shared Drive 

### Taiga for coordinating our shared to-do lists
Each Crew uses a [Tiaga dashboards](https://tree.taiga.io/) to coordinate their work.
