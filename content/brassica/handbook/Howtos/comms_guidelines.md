We’re a project driven by a fluctuating set of participants within a dynamic organising structure. This only works because we operate in a high-communication environment.

Different tools are useful for different forms of communication. The following offers an overview of which tools we use for key communication forms within the collective.

## Opting in/out of different forms of involvement in the Brassica Project = RADicalise

The [RADicalise tool](https://brassica.radhousing.org/) is used by participants and collaborators to communicate their intentions for how they want to be involved in the project, updating this periodically by responding to contribution invitations and opting-in (or out) of different forms of participation.

## Instant Messaging = Matrix

We use [Matrix](https://matrix.org/try-matrix/) as our tool for day-to-day real-time chat.
We can provide set-up support as part of the onboarding process (and can get any additional tech support from Merri-bek Tech)

Within the Brassica Matrix Space we have several rooms:

#### _Brassica Project_

This is the ‘announcements’ channel. Crew use it for meeting announcements, decisions updates, calls to action, and in Loomio threads that need attention to drive the Brassica Collective's RAD project forward. While Loomio is for focused discussion and decisions, this space is good to draw people's attention to items needing action

#### _Brassica Chat_

This is our ‘chat’ channel where participants are welcome to share any social chatter (to keep the "Brassica Project" channel clearer for calls to action). You are welcome to ‘dip into’ this chat when you’re feeling social and mute/ignore it otherwise.

### _Crew channels_

We also have a channel for each of our crew to organise, mostly we use it to talk about our work while we're working on it. So while you’re not actively participating on a given crew you can mute it.  
You can send direct messages to anyone, which is great if you’ve just got a quick question that you want an immediate answer to..

## Collaboration Tools

### Focused Discussion and Decision Making = Loomio

Loomio is our tool for decision making and thoughtful discussions.

Posting on Loomio won't necessarily alert everyone. An email notification will be sent if you invite people to a thread or poll. To allow for different modes of interactions, consider announcing a 'call to action' in the Brassica Project Matrix chat.

Subgroups on Loomio are used to collect related sets of closed-threads that may need to be reviewed. For example, we have subgroups for 'Agreement proposals' and 'Meeting minutes'.

### Strategic Roadmap = Handbook

### Current Agreements and Processes = Handbook

### Draft Agreements and Processes = Shared Drive

### Coordinating our shared to-do lists = Taiga Dashboards

Each Crew uses a [Tiaga dashboards](https://tree.taiga.io/) to coordinate their work.
