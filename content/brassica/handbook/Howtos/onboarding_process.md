New participants are supported through a largely self-directed onboarding process, this includes:   

#### Talking through the Context Checklist with an onboarding supporter and asking for help to gain relevant context as needed 
  > *This process is intended to both help those in support roles remember areas where new participants may need support to feel confident in co-creating our collective practices going forward,. The check-list can also function as a check-list for each new participant to identify the areas of support they need to actively engage in our collective practices. Talking through this checklist may need to occur over multiple sessions depending on a new participant's existing forms of context.*


#### Sharing relevant context for collaborating
  > *As you gather context about participating in the Brassica Collective, please share anything you feel is relevant about your approach to collaborative projects as needed (e.g., your style of leadership, types of tasks you tend to avoid, how much experience you have at navigating conflict well together, etc.,)* 


#### Sharing your statement of confidence in participating in the Brassica Collective 
  >*When ready, please share each of the following statements with the collective to indicate how confident you are in participating in the collective (on-boarding is considered complete when all statements are shared)*:

  I feel confident that

   - [ ] I understand the foundational context of the RAD housing project
