The following check-list is intended to help us remember areas where new participants may need support to feel confident in co-creating our collective practices going forward. It is also intended to help new participants to identify how to ask for support while they develops the context required to actively engage in our collective practices. 

On-boarding is considered complete when a new participant is:
* Familiar with the RAD housing approach that inspired the Brassica Collective
* Using the Collective's communication channels.
* Understand and be acting in alignment with existing agreements
* Attending assemblies and contributing to online discussion forums  
* Engaging with all emerging agreements and processes
* Comfortable expressing confidence in participating in decisions and processes for updating and co-creating collective agreements going forward (see statement of confidence)

### Foundational Context
