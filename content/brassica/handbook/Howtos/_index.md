This section contains guides and processes for performing important steps in the collective. These are typically not created by full group processes (otherwise they would be an [agreement](../agreements)) but are usually maintained by a working group or individual.

How-tos are living documents. If you're impacted by one of these processes, and think it should be changed or could be improved, speak up in any one of our communication channels.

Examples include: 
* Our facilitation guidelines - an emergent process we are using to help us create a 'container' for intentional group processes.
* Our guidelines for on-boarding - an emergent process intended to help us support new participants gain the context and confidence to co-create our collective going forward.
* Guidelines for updating the content of this handbook - this is one of the responsibilities of the Knowledge Gardening Crew. 

If you're in a different collective, please feel free to take any of these guides and adapt them to your own purposes as needed. See the creative commmons licence details on the [about this handbook](../../handbook) page.
