# Context for Collaborators {#context-for-collaborators}

Collaborators are those who contribute to the project without, or in between intervals of, [participating](https://radhousing.org/brassica/handbook/participation) in Brassica Collective.

# Collaborator Conduct Agreement {#collaborator-conduct-agreement}

Collaborators are responsible to treat participants and each other in ways that align with our participants' Conduct [Agreement](https://radhousing.org/brassica/handbook/agreements/conduct_agreement/).

# Entry Pathways (How to become a Collaborator) {#entry-pathways-(how-to-become-a-collaborator)}

- Potential Collaborators can express interest by speaking to any current participant
- Any one participant can invite someone to become a Collaborator

Once onboarded, Collaborators are invited to opt-in to ‘seasons’ or aspects of involvement in the project (via Radicalise)

# Collaborator Responsibilities & Expectations {#collaborator-responsibilities-&-expectations}

Collaborators are responsible for communicating when and how they are available for contributing to the project.

Collaborators can expect to be invited to support the project in ad-hoc ways, and offered opportunities to practice elements of collective participation. Example contributions include;

- sharing knowledge/expertise on aspects of the project at a workshop, working-bee, or selected assemblies
- engaging with specific support requests from participants depending on capacity at the time

Collaborators are non-participant attendees. Our guidelines for non-participant attendees at workshops and assemblies apply to collaborators.

# Collaborator Onboarding Process {#collaborator-onboarding-process}

A participant takes on responsibility for supporting their invited Collaborators to understand their role in the project. At a minimum, onboarding should include supporting Collaborators to find information in the Brassica Handbook and understand the communication channels, agreements and guidelines that are relevant to the forms of contribution of interest to Collaborators, notably, our:

- The Collaborator section of [Radicalise](https://brassica.radhousing.org/auth/login)
- [Conduct Agreement](https://radhousing.org/brassica/handbook/agreements/conduct_agreement/)
- [Entry and Exit Pathways](https://radhousing.org/brassica/handbook/agreements/entry_and_exit_pathways/)

# Collaborator \< to \> Participant Pathways {#collaborator-<-to->-participant-pathways}

- Collaborators can express interest in participating at any time (via the Participation Entry Pathway)
- When participants choose to exit, they become a collaborator unless they request otherwise (to encourage past participants to stay involved in the project in add-hoc ways and/or ease the pathway for expressing interest in participate in the future)

# Exit Pathways (Ending Collaboration) {#exit-pathways-(ending-collaboration)}

A Collaborator will be considered to have opted-out of their involvement in the collective if any of the following apply:

- Explicitly opt-out of collaborating with no intention of returning (on Radicalise);
- Invitations to opt-in to collaborations nor responded to for 3 seasons
- Meeting the criteria for exiting the collective defined for participants in other collective agreements

Collaborators can request to be re-onboarded as a collaborator by any one participant at any time

# Collaboration Exit Process {#collaboration-exit-process}

Brassica Crews will coordinate the following process for a Collaborator when they exit:

- Removing access to the collective’s communication channels
- An invitation to a Brassica gathering (where current participants can thank them for their contributions and celebrate their choice to exit)

# Review Conditions {#review-conditions}

These guidelines will be reviewed in any of the following conditions:

- Whenever a participant proposes an amendment to these guidelines
- Every two years from date of the last review

# Context Questions & Assumptions {#context-questions-&-assumptions}
