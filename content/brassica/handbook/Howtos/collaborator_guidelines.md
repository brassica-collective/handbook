Collaborators are [non-participants](../guidelines_non-participant) whose involvement in the project includes contributing without, or in between intervals of, [participating](../../participation) in Brassica Collective.

### Collaborator Responsibilities & Expectations

Collaborators are responsible for treating participants and each other in ways that align with our participants' [Conduct Agreement](../../agreements/conduct_agreement).

Collaborators are responsible for communicating when and how they are available for contributing to the project.

Collaborators can expect to be invited to support the project in ad-hoc ways, and offered opportunities to practice elements of collective participation. Example contributions include;

- attending Assemblies and participant-workshops as [non-participants](../guidelines_non-participant)
- sharing knowledge/expertise on aspects of the project at a workshop, working-bee, or selected assemblies
- engaging with specific support requests from participants depending on capacity at the time

Our guidelines for non-participant attendees at workshops and assemblies apply to collaborators.

### Entry Pathways (_How to become a Collaborator_)

- Interest in contributing to the project can be expressed by speaking to any current participant;
- Any one participant can invite someone to become a Collaborator

Once onboarded, Collaborators can be invited to opt-in to ‘seasons’ or aspects of involvement in the project (via Radicalise)

### Collaborator On-boarding Process

A participant takes on responsibility for supporting their invited Collaborators to understand their role in the project. At a minimum, onboarding should include supporting Collaborators to find information in the Brassica Handbook and understand the communication channels, agreements and guidelines that are relevant to the forms of contribution of interest to Collaborators, notably, our:

- The Collaborator section of [Radicalise](https://brassica.radhousing.org/auth/login)
- [Conduct Agreement](../../agreements/conduct_agreement)
- [Participation Entry and Exit Pathways](../../agreements/entry_and_exit_pathways)

### Participator/Collaborator Pathways

- Collaborators can [express interest in participating](https://brassica.radhousing.org/collective/brassica/interest) at any time
- When participants [choose to exit](../../agreements/entry_and_exit_pathways/#exit-pathway), they become a collaborator unless they request otherwise (to encourage past participants to stay involved in the project in add-hoc ways and/or ease the pathway for expressing interest in participate in the future)

### Exit Pathways (Ending Collaboration)

A Collaborator will be considered to have opted-out of their involvement in the collective if any of the following apply:

- Explicitly opt-out of collaborating with no intention of returning (on Radicalise);
- Invitations to opt-in to collaborations nor responded to for 3 seasons
- Meeting the criteria for exiting the collective defined for participants in other collective agreements

Collaborators can request to be re-onboarded as a collaborator by any one participant at any time

### Collaboration Exit Process

Brassica [Crews](../../participation/crew) will coordinate the following process for a Collaborator when they exit:

- Removing access to the collective’s communication channels
- An invitation to a Brassica gathering (where current participants can thank them for their contributions and celebrate their choice to exit)

### Review Conditions

These guidelines will be reviewed in any of the following conditions:

- Whenever a participant proposes an amendment to these guidelines
- Every two years from date of the last review
