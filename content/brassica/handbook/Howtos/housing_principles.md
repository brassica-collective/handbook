## Context

### What are Housing Principles?

Housing Principles are agreed propositions for aspects of how the collective acquires properties and builds or retrofits housing. Principles are general enough that they can be applied across multiple properties and expressed in multiple ways.

Housing Principles are informed by:
* Collective Values
* RAD Housing Principles

Housing Principles are one of several factors which inform:
* Property Purchase Criteria

### What is the expected output?

Housing Principles are expected to be expressed as a collective [Agreement](../../agreements), perhaps as part of a Property Purchase and/or House Retrofit agreement.

### Implied RAD Housing Principles

The following principles are derived from the four areas of the RAD Model, which aims to *"**Retrofit** and **Decommodify** housing **Collectively**, and in **Solidarity**"*.

**Retrofit Principles**

* **Retrofit Unsustainable Homes**: Where possible we choose houses that are not currently suited to sustainable and resilient living to improve, so that our work increases the sum total of such homes.

**Decommodify Principles**

* **Preference High Occupancy Potential**: We prefer larger sites that can house more people, as this provides more housing per dollar than smaller sites, providing we can do a good job of living collectively.

**Collective Principles**

* **Support Diverse Living Styles**: We want to end up with a range of different spaces to suit different people and circumstances, so preference sites that increase the diversity of the spaces in the collective.

**Solidarity Principles**

* **Sited for Survival**: We choose sites that have a low likelihood, in comparison to the surrounding neighbourhood, of being wiped out in a disaster such as flood, fire, storm, etc. This is not so that we can be safe while others are not, but so that we can anchor local resilience efforts in case of a disaster.
