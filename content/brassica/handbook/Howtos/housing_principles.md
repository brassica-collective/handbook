## Context

### What are Housing Principles?

Housing Principles are agreed propositions for aspects of how the collective acquires properties and builds or retrofits housing. Principles are general enough that they can be applied across multiple properties and expressed in multiple ways.

Housing Principles are informed by:
* Collective Values
* RAD Housing Principles

Housing Principles are one of several factors which inform:
* Property Purchase Criteria

### What is the expected output?

Housing Principles are expected to be expressed as a collective [Agreement](../../agreements), perhaps as part of a Property Purchase and/or House Retrofit agreement.
