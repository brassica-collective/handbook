The following is a summary of the objectives and associated decision-making scope delegated to the Process and Strategy (PAS) Crew by participants of the Brassica Collective (via the consent process detailed in our interim decision making process, with the proposal and discussion documented on Loomio). 

## Goal 
The PAS Crew goal is to ensure that the Brassica Collective can implement the RAD housing approach to retrofit, and decommodify existing suburban housing so that we, and others, can live in secure, resilient and affordable housing.

## Objectives
1. Operationalise the T2S model and empower the Brassica Collective to start retrofitting and decommodifying houses 
2. Drive group relational development, facilitation, and governance practices for the Brassica Collective

## Scope of Delegation
The implementation of the above objectives are delegated to the PAS Crew, who may consult with Collective participants, as per the process for minor decisions, with regard to:
* Determining structure, time, location, and facilitation of meetings (e.g., assemblies and workshops),
* Choosing and facilitating the group's online communication processes (e.g., email, chat, Loomio),
* Choosing what updates to supply to supporters,
* Determining interim decision making process, to be retired once voyagers have decided on one themselves, and
* Developing transparent operational systems (e.g., systems for moving money, managing legal entities, etc.).
 
### Scope Notes
The decision scope outlined above is more restricted than the initial scope of decisions delegated to the PAS Crew, because we have since: 
1. Removed those responsibilities associated with the broader RAD Housing Project goals of developing a legal and financial framework for the T2S model 
2. Agreed to clarify the responsibilities and expectations of participants
3. Agreed to an Entry Pathway that distributes responsibility for inviting new participants into the collective 

## Timeline
Given the objectives outlined above, we expect the PAS Crew to be ongoing. 
Any updates on how the PAS Crew is working towards the above objectives will be included in the Crew report backs at each Assembly.
