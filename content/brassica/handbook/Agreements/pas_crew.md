The following is a summary of the objectives and associated decision-making scope delegated to the Process and Strategy (PAS) Crew by participants of the Brassica Collective (via the consent process detailed in our interim decision making process, with the proposal and discussion documented on Loomio). 

## Goal 
The PAS Crew goal is to ensure that the Brassica Collective can implement the RAD housing approach to retrofit, and decommodify existing suburban housing so that we, and others, can live in secure, resilient and affordable housing.

## Objectives
1. Operationalise the T2S model and empower the Brassica Collective to start retrofitting and decommodifying houses 
2. Drive group relational development, facilitation, and governance practices for the Brassica Collective

## Scope 
In the implementation of the above objectives, the PAS Crew can make decisions within the scope of:
* Determining structure, time, location, and facilitation of meetings (e.g., assemblies and workshops)
* Choosing and facilitating the group's online communication processes (e.g., email, chat, Loomio)
* Choosing what updates to supply to supporters
* Determining interim decision making process, to be retired once voyagers have decided on one themselves
* Developing transparent operational systems (e.g., systems for moving money, managing legal entities, etc.)

PAS Crew may also consult with Collective participants as per the process for minor decisions.
