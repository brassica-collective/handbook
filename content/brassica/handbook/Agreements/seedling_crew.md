The following is a summary of the objectives and associated decision-making scope delegated to the Seedling Crew by participants of the Brassica Collective (via the consent process detailed in our interim decision making process, with the proposal and discussion documented on Loomio). 

## Goal 
The Seedling Crew goal is to establish the criteria for the purchase of a property in line with the values and objectives of the Brassica Collective. The role of the Seedling Crew is to create a purchase framework, not purchase the property itself. Once this is completed, new Crews will be established to implement the purchase and retrofit.

## Objectives

1. Determine the requirements and criteria for the initial property to be purchased by the Collective.

# Delegated Decisions
The Crew can make decisions to:
* Determine their own internal processes (currently modelled on that used by the PAS Crew),
* Proceed with the objectives as outlined above, 
* Make decisions within the scope of delegation outlined above, and
* Represent and act on behalf of the Brassica Collective to build relationships and solidarity in the service of these objectives.

The Crew may also consult with Collective participants as per the process for minor decisions, and consult and petition the PAS Crew for funds as needed.

## In-Scope 
The requirements and criteria for the initial property to be purchased by the Collective may include, but are not limited to, the following considerations:

* Location (distance from services/transport, nearby future purchase opportunities, preferred LGA)
* Block qualities (size, aspect, soil, neighbours)
* Accessibility
* House size, features, condition and costs to retrofit 
* Retrofit end goals and appropriate approaches
* Overall budget (including retrofit)
* Personal preferences and needs of Collective participants (pending consultation and with understanding that the first property has the potential to be lived in by any member of the Collective)
* Contacting and consulting professionals and curate relationships that will aid in the purchase and retrofitting process.
* Creating a document which can be handed over to the Crew (yet undetermined) responsible for the purchase of the house.
* Documenting the process which the Seedling Crew uses so it may be replicated in the future for other purchases.

Funds may requested from the PAS Crew  for things such as:
* Resources to allow for better research, such as real estate results.
* Consultancy services of relevant specialists, such as architects, quantity surveyors, or accessibility services.
* Consultation with local First Nations land councils

## Out-of-Scope 
The Seedling Crew is not expected to be responsible for the following:

* Determining “the” property to be purchased.
* Arranging finances or loans.
* Raising funds within or for the Collective.
* Design of site, house, or garden.
* Contracting tradespeople or acquiring construction materials.
* Submitting documentation or approval needed from councils for construction.
