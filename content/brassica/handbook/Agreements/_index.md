## Context
The types of agreements we make are up to us. 

Potential aspects of our collective practices we could form agreements about include:
- Grounding-principles: agreements about what principles we want to keep in mind to help us act in [transformative solidarity](https://commonslibrary.org/solidarity-the-past-present-and-future-of-a-world-changing-idea/) with groups with different strategies for acting on collective obligations for creating more just futures together.
- Values-alignment: agreements about the values we want to keep in mind so they can inform our project
- Decision-making: agreements about the processes we use for making specific types of decisions in different ways
- Codes of conduct: agreements about how we choose to conduct ourselves in relation to each other, including our personal conduct practices, conflict resolution processes, and processes for reducing harm (and healing from harm when it occurs).
- Responsibilities & Expectations: agreements about what responsibilities we each agree to by participating in this collective in different ways, and what we can expect from the collective as participants.
- Entry & Exit Pathways: agreements that establish processes for inviting additional participants to collaborate with us going forward and under what conditions people might pause and/or stop participating.
- Operational processes: agreements about how we manage money, what technologies we choose to use.
These and other agreements may be useful if we choose to create more formal set of group agreements, such as a [constitution](https://commonslibrary.org/constitutions-how-to-build-durable-groups/)

## Agreement Proposals
We are also currently in the process of articulating the first version of our more detailed 'Participation Agreements': 
- Supporter Roles Agreement, which aims to set-up a clear support structure that our other agreements can reference to help us learn to collectively take responsibility for navigating conflict well together. 
- Conduct Agreement, which aims to articulate our shared values around how we conduct ourselves in relation to each other, and how we intend to respond in situations where a participant's conduct does not align with our collective expectations. 
- Responsibilities & Expectations Agreement, which is intended to clarify what responsibilities we each agree to by participating in this collective in different ways, and what we can expect from the collective as participants.
- Entry & Exit Pathways Agreement, which outlines our processes for inviting additional participants to collaborate with us on this experiment in implementing RAD housing and co-creating our collective living practices going forward and under what conditions people might stop participating.
For those who are not currently able to participate in the Brassica Collective, yet want to stay informed for future participation possibilities and/or ad-hoc contributions to the project (such as attending working-bees), we encourage maintaining a ['supporter'](supporters/) role.  

## Register of Agreements
As we make agreements as a collective, they will be added here. We currently have an [interim process](../interim_processes/decision_making_process) for making decisions about our initial agreements. This will be replaced with the decision-making agreements we co-create.
