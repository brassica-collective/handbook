## Context
The types of agreements we make are up to us. Potential aspects of our collective practices we could form agreements about include:
- Grounding-principles: agreements about what principles we want to keep in mind to help us act in [transformative solidarity](https://commonslibrary.org/solidarity-the-past-present-and-future-of-a-world-changing-idea/) with groups with different strategies for acting on collective obligations for creating more just futures together.
- Values-alignment: agreements about the values we want to keep in mind so they can inform our project
- Decision-making: agreements about the processes we use for making specific types of decisions in different ways
- Codes of conduct: agreements about how we choose to conduct ourselves in relation to each other, including our personal conduct practices, conflict resolution processes, and processes for reducing harm (and healing from harm when it occurs).
- Operational processes: agreements about how we manage money, what technologies we choose to use.

## Register of Agreements
As we make agreements as a collective, they will be added here. We currently have an [interim process](../interim_processes/decision_making_process) for making decisions about our initial agreements. This will be replaced with the decision-making agreements we co-create.
