The following is a summary of the objectives and associated decision-making scope delegated to the Solidarity Crew by participants of the Brassica Collective (via the consent process detailed in our interim decision making process, with the proposal and discussion documented on Loomio).

## Goal
The Solidarity Crew’s goal is to function as a ‘radical core’ that reminds the broader collective to keep prioritising solidarity actions and support political engagement.

The Solidarity Crew defines ‘solidarity’ as an ever evolving process that requires an enduring commitment to the principles of justice and the practice of doing the relational work of connecting across differences.

## Objectives

1. Developing standards and processes for collective acts of solidarity and political engagement
2. Building relationships with organisations who work on the front lines of justice movements
3. Compiling and maintaining a list of relevant resources
4. Selecting themes to highlight areas of activism that match our collective capacity and current goals each interval
5. Presenting opportunities to the collective aligned with the interval theme
6. Proposing funding for participants to attend specific training
7. An avenue of support for when navigating tensions among participants that could be alleviated by education around a specific area of broader justice movements
8. An avenue of support for collective actions in response to the identification of barriers to participation

## Scope of Delegation
The implementation of the above objectives are delegated to the Solidarity Crew, who may consult with Collective participants, as per the process for minor decisions, with regard to:
* Deciding on forms or areas of activism match our collective capacity and current goals each month
* Deciding on the criteria by which the collective will pay for participants to attend training when funds are available

### Out-of-Scope
The Solidarity Crew is not expected to be responsible for the following:
* Motivating individual participants to engage in acts of solidarity (motivation is assumed given the RAD context of the collective)
* Mediating tensions or conflict among participants (processes for this are expected to be covered by our participation agreements)
* Meeting every individual standard of accessibility in all contexts. Given conflicting accessibility needs, this is not possible (and, processes for navigating conflicting accessibility needs are expected to be covered by out participation agreements)

## Timeline
Given the objectives outlined above, we expect the Solidarity Crew to be ongoing. As these responsibilities and workload will need to be distributed amongst participants to be sustainable, we expect all participants with crewing capacity opt-in to contribute for at least one interval per year.

Any updates on how the Solidarity Crew is working towards the above objectives will be included in the Crew report backs at each Assembly.
