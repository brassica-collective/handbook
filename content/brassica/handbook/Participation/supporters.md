Supporters are those who are not currently able to commit to reliably [participating](../../participation) in Brassica Collective, yet intend to participate in the future so want to maintain an awareness about how the project is going.

Supporters can reach out to one of the current Brassica Collective participants to express interest in participating at any time to learn about the current (re)entry-processes. 

For those who aren't intending to participate, yet value the role of Brassica Collective in contributing to RAD goals and want to support in ad-hoc ways, opportunities for this include:
* Offering your knowledge/expertise on aspects of the project, putting in bread-labour by coming to working bees, etc. 
* Attending 'discussion nights' hosted by the Brassica Collective (these are shared on the RAD Housing Signal chat)* 
* Engaging with specific support requests from Crew; opting-in or out depending on capacity at the time.
