Brassica Collective is a multi-site housing project driven by an emerging group of participants. 

As a collective, we need to balance our expectations of ourselves and each other other with the variable and fluctuating capacity each of us have to contribute to this long-term project. 

To help us each participate in the ways that we can sustain, we differentiate between 'minimum' and 'opt-in' responsibilities. 

- The minimum set of responsibilities are what we expect of each other as participants of the collective. We have processes for explicitly opting out of participation in the collective when no longer able to meet these responsibilities, and for returning to participate when capacity allows. In practice this involves regularly contributing to our online discussion forum and attending in-person facilitated assemblies, engaging when prompted by [Crew](../crew/), abiding by our collective [agreements](../../agreements/), and contributing to our [group processes](../../interim_processes/).

- For the collective to move our RAD housing project forward, participants also expect each other to opt-into time-bound additional responsibilities when we have capacities so that we can distribute the workload. This includes responsibilities to participate in the collaborative work that has been delegated to our various (['Crews']()).
