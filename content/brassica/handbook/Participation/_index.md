Brassica Collective is a multi-site housing project driven by an emerging group of participants. 

As a collective, we need to balance our expectations of ourselves and each other with the variable and fluctuating capacity each of us have to meet our responsibilities to contribute to this long-term project.

To help us each participate in ways that we can sustain, we differentiate between 'minimum' and 'opt-in' responsibilities. 

- The minimum set of responsibilities are what we expect of each other as participants of the collective. This currently involves regularly attending in-person facilitated assemblies and contributing to our online discussion forum, engaging when prompted by our working groups ([Crews](crew)), abiding by our collective [agreements](../agreements) and contributing to our [group processes](../interim_processes). We also have processes for explicitly opting out of participation in the collective when no longer able to meet these responsibilities, and for returning to participate when capacity allows.

- For the collective to move our RAD housing project forward, we also expect each other to opt-into additional responsibilities when we have capacity. This helps us distribute the workload and participate in ways that we can sustain. These are additional responsibilities, for example participating in the collaborative work that has been delegated to our various [Crews](crew).

For those who don't currently have capacity to participate yet intend to in the future, we welcome them staying engaged with the project as [supporters](supporters).
