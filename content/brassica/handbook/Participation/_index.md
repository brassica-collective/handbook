Brassica Collective is a multi-site housing project driven by an emerging group of participants experimenting with one approach to implementing RAD housing goals. 

As part of this transitional pathway towards the more just futures we want to see, we seek to: 
* decentralise our decision-making processes and ways of organising;   
* practice navigating conflict and responding to harm collectively (without resorting to punishment or surveillance); 
* build our capacity for participating in the broader networks of relationships needed to take care of one another and our environments  

Within this context, we are practising balancing our expectations of ourselves and each other with the variable and fluctuating capacity each of us have to meet our various responsibilities. 

To help us each participate in ways that we can sustain, we are building intentional structures around how we interact with each other while participating in this project. 

As detailed in our Responsibilities and Expectations Agreement, this includes differentiating between 'minimum' and 'opt-in' responsibilities: 

- Our minimum responsibilities are those we expect of each other participants in this project; this includes an expectation that we support each other to take breaks from participating when unable to meet these responsibilities. 

- For the collective to move our RAD housing project forward, we also expect each other to opt in to additional responsibilities when we have capacity. This helps us distribute the workload while participating in ways that we can sustain. 

For those who don't currently have capacity to participate yet intend to in the future, we welcome them staying engaged with the project as [supporters](supporters).
