Voyagers are the core group of the Brassica Collective.

This form of participation is intended for those committed to cultivating high-trust relationships and contributing to specific decisions about process-design proposals and project implementation.

In practice we expect this to involve regularly participating in facilitated assemblies in ~ 6 weekly rhythm where we discuss upcoming decisions, do some relationship-building exercises, hear report-backs from crew - and create opportunities to join and/or form new Crew

In between assemblies, Crew will also make explicit requests for Voyagers to participate in online processes for making asynchronous collective decisions.

Depending on changing circumstances, Voyagers can opt-in for periods of time with additional responsibilities as part of one or more Crew and/or explicitly opt-out of decision-making responsibilities for short-periods of time (e.g., to rest and support more sustainable long-term participation).

A minimum expectation for Voyagers is that they engage when prompted by [Crew](../crew/), abide by our collective [agreements](../../agreements/), and contribute to our [group processes](../../interim_processes/)
