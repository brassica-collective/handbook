We will need to make a lot of agreements together. We have a few interim processes to help us make these agreements, and other decisions, in the meantime.
Currently, these include:
 * An [interim decision-making process](decision_making_process) to help us make initial decisions together while cultivating a shared context from which to co-create more appropriate agreements for the each of the many types of decisions we hope to make together.
 * Some example [assembly facilitation processes](assembly_facilitation) that we can build upon together as we each take turns facilitating our gatherings.
