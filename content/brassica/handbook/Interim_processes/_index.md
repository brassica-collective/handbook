We will need to make a lot of agreements together. We have a few interim processes to help us make these agreements, and other decisions, in the meantime.
Currently, these include:
 * Some example [assembly facilitation processes](assembly_facilitation) that we can build upon together as we each take turns facilitating our gatherings.
 * An [interim decision-making process](decision_making_process) to help us make initial decisions together while cultivating a shared context from which to co-create more appropriate agreements for the each of the many types of decisions we hope to make together.
 * An [interim transitional equity fund](te_fund) that we can use to pool our money to fund the development of formal legal & financial structures.
 * An [interim guidelines for on-boarding](onboarding_process) to help us support new participants to gain the context and confidence to co-create our collective going forward.
