# Living Collectively & in Solidarity

The RAD housing project offers one small way to contribute to prefiguring better futures by providing opportunities to:

 * Live collectively in ways that help us to practice commoning (e.g., by embracing unexpected outcomes of our participatory processes as they emerge from the collective efforts of those who show up)

 * Act in solidarity with more radical movements for change 
(e.g., by supporting broader efforts to decommodify our basic needs, decolonise our ways of relating, and dismantle oppressive systems locally and globally)


## Living Collectively 
Jade’s just outlined one way to redirect pooled financial resources towards collectively stewarding climate resilient housing.

This model relies on the cost savings that can be unlocked by multiple people living together in higher-density than suburban expectations.  

This model may also provides other benefits, including helping to lower consumption, reduce waste, combat isolation, and be more intentional with our acts of solidarity. 

However, these benefits do not necessarily follow from simply living in proximity with each other.  

To live together in ways that generate collective well-being, we need to actively build the distributed networks of relationships within which we can take care of one another and our environments.

This effort includes everything from the administrative hurdles of participating in decision-making processes to the psychosocial unlearning required to navigate conflict well within emergent group dynamics.   

## Collaborative living, but different to this... 
In addition to the relational work of navigating group-dynamics, there is also relational effort involved in managing the project of acquiring, retrofitting, and maintaining the infrastructure needed for collaborative housing.

It can be difficult to balance establishing good group processes with effective project-management, and there are many different approaches.

For instance, some approaches are group-first - carefully building the relational scaffolding needed to live collectively before slowly co-creating the physical infrastructure to house the group along the way. This has led to many thriving intentional communities, however it relies on those with capacity to dive all-in on a journey with an unclear direction or exit pathway.

Other approaches also begin by forming a group with shared values and taking the time to build relationships, yet focus on co-creating a clear vision and project-plan for their intended ‘forever homes’, before living together. These approaches have also had many successes, yet groups often spend years visioning before beginning to live together.

There are also some projects that pre-envision sharable infrastructure while relying on collaboration between residents to emerge once already living across shared spaces. 

## Project-Group Balance
RAD Housing is informed by many of the patterns that have been established through existing collective projects. 

The most distinctive feature is the transitional processes for acquiring and retrofitting houses for collective stewardship in ways that are able to emerge differently depending on the local context. 

However, it is also worth highlighting that implementing RAD housing goals requires finding a sustainable balance between the initial project-vision and the emergent group dynamics of those who show-up and participate in implementing - and potentially changing - those visions in practice.

To navigate this balance collectively, we need to avoid the temptation to hold tightly to own vision of the project, 
and instead build relationships that allow for genuine participation in collective co-creation processes 

## Commoning 
This ability to remain open to the possibility of genuinely co-created futures is an aspect of commoning. 

I've an introduction to this comcept on the Commons Social Change Library.  

But the short version is that the verb commoning builds on uses of commons as a noun, to draw attention to the dynamic actions involved in participating in co-creating common spaces.

By shifting us away from treating commons as predefined containers for specific types of relations, 
and towards a view of commons as emerging from dynamic systems of relations that continually re-create shared spaces, 
this concept offers a reminder of the need to practice how we relate to each other across our differences. 

I’ll come back to this notion of building relationships across difference in a bit, but the important point for now is that this process can feel uncomfortable yet offers a pathway to contributing to changing structures by changing ourselves.  

## Swarming on a first house
With commoning in mind, RAD housing seeks to balance the emergent group-project dynamics by creating explicit processes for practicing collective actions that contribute to shard goals. 

One way that the model does this is through the expectation that more people will contribute to acquiring and retrofitting each house than will eventually live in that specific house - this is especially so for the first house of each collective. 

Taking a commoning approach to RAD houses also allows for the possibility that the folk who end up living in each established house are not necessarily those who choose to live there during the retrofit stage. 

For example, if a group of 18 people ‘swarm’ their collective efforts to acquire a 3-bedroom property and retrofit it into one with 8 bedrooms across two dwellings, less than half the group will be housed there once established. 

Given this, the collective needs to have processes for deciding which participants are prioritised as residents when rooms in Established Properties become available should not be tied to financial or labour contributions.

## Multi-house collectives
The good news is that the more participants able to swarm on each house, the sooner the collective is able to afford an additional house to put into the retrofitting and decommodifying pipeline - ensuring that all participants are able to be directly housed eventually.  

Then, by collectively stewarding a range of different retrofitted house configurations across multiple properties, folk can self-organise into compatible co-living arrangements that can be re-considered as housing needs change over time.

In this context, the practice of navigating the emerging relational dynamics is crucial for both within-house collective living, 
and across-property practices for stewarding these houses for broader benefit.

We also recommend capping each collective at a size that supports high-trust relationships while allowing flexibility in living arrangements 
- in this example, it's 43 people across 6 properties / 12 houses.

Once established, collectives could then support emerging projects seeking to retrofit and decommodify more housing.   

## Participating in living collectively
A key aspect of emerging relational dynamics in multi-house collectives are the different decision-making processes needed within and across houses 

The options for how we make decisions together are embedded within the broader governance practices that structure our relationships.
Within colonial contexts, capitalism pressures us to default to ways of relating that perpetuate broader oppressive structures. 
To resist this, we need to get better at exploring, calibrating, and articulating shared expectations around each aspect of participation in collective practices.
 
A key consideration here is that some decisions impact multiple housing sites, while others only impact one property, or a single house, or even one of the various spaces within a house. 

These decisions may also differ depending on the relevant streams within the process of transitioning to stewardship.  
Other factors include how often agreements need to be reviewed to ensure shared expectations can change as new perspectives emerge.

So, instead of prescribing a specific approach to making decisions, RAD housing collectives are expected to co-create their own processes for determining who makes what decisions, when. 

# Solidairty 
In addition to navigating the relational dynamics within RAD housing projects, we also need to be building relationships with those who are focusing on other strategies within the broader fight for better futures.

Which brings us to solidarity

One of the risks of building little bubbles that meet real human needs is the impulse to build a fence around them.  
To avoid this, we need be acting in solidarity in as many ways as possible   

Here, I am specifically drawing on the concept of ‘transformative solidarity’, which articulates the connection between a set of principle and practices through which we seek to change structures while also changing ourselves.


## Acting in Solidarity...
Solidarity requires an enduring commitment to the principles of justice and the practice of doing the relational work of connecting across differences. 

To do this, we need to recognise the debts being accrued through historical and ongoing injustices, 
We need to engage in processes of reparation and transformation 
and we need to figure out how to invest in more just co-created futures for those yet to come 

As our liberation is dependent on the liberation of all,
we also need to recognise our partial perspectives 
and learn to act with courage, curiosity, and humility 

At this point it’s important to notes that the RAD approach to housing began in the context of currently-housed settlers getting increasingly concerned about the climate and housing crises  

It is from this perspective that, I want to highlight four dimensions of solidarity that we see as minimum considerations when implementing RAD Housing projects in similar contexts. 

## Acting in Solidarity with First Nations 
How can people implementing RAD Housing projects act in solidarity with First Nations peoples fighting for land-back and self-determination? 

Of course, specific actions of solidarity should always be formed through relationships with those most impacted. 
At the same time, we need to avoid re-creating extractive expectations that First Nations people benefit from being in relation with us.   

So, while the housing crisis may be new for some of us, it is important to remember that
First Nation peoples have experienced generations of being violently displaced from their homes by colonising settles seeking capitalist gains.

And First Nations people have provided many processe through which housing collectives could be making tangible ‘think-local’ actions:

This includes the Wurundjeri Land Council consultation services, and their process for forming agreements about how to protect and manage the land on specific properties in ways that are informed by First Nations knowledge systems.

As the land-back movement grows, it may also be possible to enshrine legal commitments into collective stewardship practices that help guide our participation in full land-back protocols 

For those invited to, it may also be possible to form ‘living labs’ that help us practice being in ‘communities of inquiry’ that meaningfully engage with Indigenous knowledge systems. 
This approach could contribute to more symbiotic relationships between human and non-human living systems, and help us form stewarding practices that honour the networked commons of land, living spaces, resources, and contextualised knowledge practices.

These are just few ideas, so, when we come to discussion I'm keen hear some more tangible actions that housing collectives can be prioritising to contribute to First Nations justice. 


## Acting in Solidarity with refugees and people who are disproportionately at risk of displacement
We should also be acting in solidarity with people who are disproportionately at risk of displacement in a global context.
As you’re likely aware, these risks that are being amplified by the climate crisis - with island countries such as Tuvalu and Vanuatu expected to be complete submerged by the end of this century.

One action to acknowledge these unjust impacts is to take responsibility for our daily contributions to the causes of this crisis.
For example, we could cap household emissions at a target that matches those nations most at risk, rather than waiting on local governments or international guidance to direct us. 

At the same time, we could be supporting refugees more directly by designing physical infrastructure and relational practices for our housing so that we can provide emergency shelter for people navigating broader refugee support systems. 

Again, I’m keen to hear other tangible actions housing collectives can be prioritising to contribute to refugee and climate justice during our discussions. 

## Acting in Solidarity with experincing housing stress
The housing crisis is compounding the impacts of the climate crisis on First Nations peoples and refugees, 
as well as contributing to the injustices faced by people who are homeless, living in precarious situations, 
struggling to find affordable rentals, navigating underfunded infrastructure like public housing, 
or otherwise experiencing housing stress.      

As with the other forms of justice, we need structural change to achieve equitable housing 

In the meantime, a housing collective might be able to act in solidarity with those experiencing housing stress by 
showing up to eviction defences, designing with specific accessibility needs in mind, 
and forming agreements for emergency-shelter so that none of their available housing are left empty. 

These are just a few ideas - during our discussion I'd particularly like to hear about those you've experience with. 

[Note it asked: unaffordable  housing costs are more than 30% of income for those households in the bottom 40% of the national income distribution - for example, for a gross income of less than $68,000p/a, paying more than $380 per week in housing costs is considered unaffordable] 

## Acting in Solidarity with Workers
In addition to supporting resistance efforts, we should also be supporting movements that create space in the cracks of late-stage capitalism for the possibility of better futures.  

For example, unionised worker-owned cooperatives highlight the transformative power of creating “dignified, safe, and sustainable livelihoods” that have the potential to transform the economy.

Housing projects are in a position to contribute to this transformation. 

For example, in addition to encouraging union membership, labour organising and collectivising everyday resources, 
housing collectives could actively seek out worker-owned cooperatives to supply us with relevant skills, labour, products, and services.

In addition to functioning as a customer for emerging worker-cooperatives, 
prioritising participation in the solidarity economy can also help us avoid the temptation of de-valuing the
labour required to implement RAD housing projects.  

Again - more ideas very welcome!
 
## Solidarity 
As these four dimensions of solidarity remind us, we wouldn’t need RAD housing if we already lived in a world where First Nations sovereignty was honoured;
where no one was being displaced by our failures to adapt to climate change; 
where housing was available to all; 
and where self-determined labour was directed for people not profit.  

This is why we’ve positioned these four dimensions of solidarity as minimum considerations for any implementation of RAD housing. 

However, it’s worth reiterating the importance of building relationships that inform acts of solidarity - we need to be listening to those with direct experiences in resisting each of the specific injustices that impact us all. 

We also need to be open to our vision of a better future changing as we participate in commoning with people with different perspectives from ours. 

And, in the meantime, we expect that each housing collective will also need to consider additional acts of solidarity that leverage the specific dimensions of privilege - and specific experiences of oppression - among those involved. 

## RAD HOUSING
Okay, thanks for listening! 

Before we move to a more open discussion, I’ll just note that a more detailed description of the Transition to Stewardship model is available at radhousing.org , and we’ll be adding more details about the broader RAD housing approach soon. 

We've allowed some discussion time, and also want to encourage those with specific feedback or collaboration ideas to reach out to us via the rad-crew email (crew@radhousing.org)
