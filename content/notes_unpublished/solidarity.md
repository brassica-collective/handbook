 Solidairty 
In addition to navigating the relational dynamics within RAD housing projects, we also need to be building relationships with those who are focusing on other strategies within the broader fight for better futures.

Which brings us to solidarity

One of the risks of building little bubbles that meet real human needs is the impulse to build a fence around them.  
To avoid this, we need be acting in solidarity in as many ways as possible   

Here, I am specifically drawing on the concept of ‘transformative solidarity’, which articulates the connection between a set of principle and practices through which we seek to change structures while also changing ourselves.


## Acting in Solidarity...
Solidarity requires an enduring commitment to the principles of justice and the practice of doing the relational work of connecting across differences. 

To do this, we need to recognise the debts being accrued through historical and ongoing injustices, 
We need to engage in processes of reparation and transformation 
and we need to figure out how to invest in more just co-created futures for those yet to come 

As our liberation is dependent on the liberation of all,
we also need to recognise our partial perspectives 
and learn to act with courage, curiosity, and humility 

At this point it’s important to notes that the RAD approach to housing began in the context of currently-housed settlers getting increasingly concerned about the climate and housing crises  

It is from this perspective that, I want to highlight four dimensions of solidarity that we see as minimum considerations when implementing RAD Housing projects in similar contexts. 

## Acting in Solidarity with First Nations 
How can people implementing RAD Housing projects act in solidarity with First Nations peoples fighting for land-back and self-determination? 

Of course, specific actions of solidarity should always be formed through relationships with those most impacted. 
At the same time, we need to avoid re-creating extractive expectations that First Nations people benefit from being in relation with us.   

So, while the housing crisis may be new for some of us, it is important to remember that
First Nation peoples have experienced generations of being violently displaced from their homes by colonising settles seeking capitalist gains.

And First Nations people have provided many processe through which housing collectives could be making tangible ‘think-local’ actions:

This includes the Wurundjeri Land Council consultation services, and their process for forming agreements about how to protect and manage the land on specific properties in ways that are informed by First Nations knowledge systems.

As the land-back movement grows, it may also be possible to enshrine legal commitments into collective stewardship practices that help guide our participation in full land-back protocols 

For those invited to, it may also be possible to form ‘living labs’ that help us practice being in ‘communities of inquiry’ that meaningfully engage with Indigenous knowledge systems. 
This approach could contribute to more symbiotic relationships between human and non-human living systems, and help us form stewarding practices that honour the networked commons of land, living spaces, resources, and contextualised knowledge practices.

These are just few ideas, so, when we come to discussion I'm keen hear some more tangible actions that housing collectives can be prioritising to contribute to First Nations justice. 


## Acting in Solidarity with refugees and people who are disproportionately at risk of displacement
We should also be acting in solidarity with people who are disproportionately at risk of displacement in a global context.
As you’re likely aware, these risks that are being amplified by the climate crisis - with island countries such as Tuvalu and Vanuatu expected to be complete submerged by the end of this century.

One action to acknowledge these unjust impacts is to take responsibility for our daily contributions to the causes of this crisis.
For example, we could cap household emissions at a target that matches those nations most at risk, rather than waiting on local governments or international guidance to direct us. 

At the same time, we could be supporting refugees more directly by designing physical infrastructure and relational practices for our housing so that we can provide emergency shelter for people navigating broader refugee support systems. 

Again, I’m keen to hear other tangible actions housing collectives can be prioritising to contribute to refugee and climate justice during our discussions. 

## Acting in Solidarity with experincing housing stress
The housing crisis is compounding the impacts of the climate crisis on First Nations peoples and refugees, 
as well as contributing to the injustices faced by people who are homeless, living in precarious situations, 
struggling to find affordable rentals, navigating underfunded infrastructure like public housing, 
or otherwise experiencing housing stress.      

As with the other forms of justice, we need structural change to achieve equitable housing 

In the meantime, a housing collective might be able to act in solidarity with those experiencing housing stress by 
showing up to eviction defences, designing with specific accessibility needs in mind, 
and forming agreements for emergency-shelter so that none of their available housing are left empty. 

These are just a few ideas - during our discussion I'd particularly like to hear about those you've experience with. 

[Note it asked: unaffordable  housing costs are more than 30% of income for those households in the bottom 40% of the national income distribution - for example, for a gross income of less than $68,000p/a, paying more than $380 per week in housing costs is considered unaffordable] 

## Acting in Solidarity with Workers
In addition to supporting resistance efforts, we should also be supporting movements that create space in the cracks of late-stage capitalism for the possibility of better futures.  

For example, unionised worker-owned cooperatives highlight the transformative power of creating “dignified, safe, and sustainable livelihoods” that have the potential to transform the economy.

Housing projects are in a position to contribute to this transformation. 

For example, in addition to encouraging union membership, labour organising and collectivising everyday resources, 
housing collectives could actively seek out worker-owned cooperatives to supply us with relevant skills, labour, products, and services.

In addition to functioning as a customer for emerging worker-cooperatives, 
prioritising participation in the solidarity economy can also help us avoid the temptation of de-valuing the
labour required to implement RAD housing projects.  

Again - more ideas very welcome!
 
## Solidarity 
As these four dimensions of solidarity remind us, we wouldn’t need RAD housing if we already lived in a world where First Nations sovereignty was honoured;
where no one was being displaced by our failures to adapt to climate change; 
where housing was available to all; 
and where self-determined labour was directed for people not profit.  

This is why we’ve positioned these four dimensions of solidarity as minimum considerations for any implementation of RAD housing. 

However, it’s worth reiterating the importance of building relationships that inform acts of solidarity - we need to be listening to those with direct experiences in resisting each of the specific injustices that impact us all. 

We also need to be open to our vision of a better future changing as we participate in commoning with people with different perspectives from ours. 

And, in the meantime, we expect that each housing collective will also need to consider additional acts of solidarity that leverage the specific dimensions of privilege - and specific experiences of oppression - among those involved.
