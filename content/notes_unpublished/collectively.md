The RAD housing project offers one small way to contribute to prefiguring better futures by providing opportunities to:

 * Live collectively in ways that help us to practice commoning by embracing unexpected outcomes of our participatory processes as they emerge from the collective efforts of those who show up.

 * Act in solidarity with more radical movements for change by supporting broader efforts to decommodify our basic needs, decolonise our ways of relating, and dismantle oppressive systems locally and globally.


## Living Collectively 
The [transition to stewardship model]() is a tool for redirect pooled financial resources towards collectively stewarding climate resilient housing.

This model relies on the cost savings that can be unlocked by multiple people living together in higher-density than suburban expectations.  

This model may also provides other benefits, including helping to lower consumption, reduce waste, combat isolation, and be more intentional with our acts of solidarity. 

However, these benefits do not necessarily follow from simply living in proximity with each other.  

To live together in ways that generate collective well-being, we need to actively build the distributed networks of relationships within which we can take care of one another and our environments.

This effort includes everything from the administrative hurdles of participating in decision-making processes to the psychosocial unlearning required to navigate conflict well within emergent group dynamics.   

## Collaborative living, but different to this... 
In addition to the relational work of navigating group-dynamics, there is also relational effort involved in managing the project of acquiring, retrofitting, and maintaining the infrastructure needed for collaborative housing.

It can be difficult to balance establishing good group processes with effective project-management, and there are many different approaches.

For instance, some approaches are group-first - carefully building the relational scaffolding needed to live collectively before slowly co-creating the physical infrastructure to house the group along the way. This has led to many thriving intentional communities, however it relies on those with capacity to dive all-in on a journey with an unclear direction or exit pathway.

Other approaches also begin by forming a group with shared values and taking the time to build relationships, yet focus on co-creating a clear vision and project-plan for their intended ‘forever homes’, before living together. These approaches have also had many successes, yet groups often spend years visioning before beginning to live together.

There are also some projects that pre-envision sharable infrastructure while relying on collaboration between residents to emerge once already living across shared spaces. 

## Project-Group Balance
RAD Housing is informed by many of the patterns that have been established through existing collective projects. 

The most distinctive feature is the transitional processes for acquiring and retrofitting houses for collective stewardship in ways that are able to emerge differently depending on the local context. 

However, it is also worth highlighting that implementing RAD housing goals requires finding a sustainable balance between the initial project-vision and the emergent group dynamics of those who show-up and participate in implementing - and potentially changing - those visions in practice.

To navigate this balance collectively, we need to avoid the temptation to hold tightly to own vision of the project, 
and instead build relationships that allow for genuine participation in collective co-creation processes 

## Commoning 
This ability to remain open to the possibility of genuinely co-created futures is an aspect of commoning. 

I've an introduction to this comcept on the Commons Social Change Library.  

But the short version is that the verb commoning builds on uses of commons as a noun, to draw attention to the dynamic actions involved in participating in co-creating common spaces.

By shifting us away from treating commons as predefined containers for specific types of relations, 
and towards a view of commons as emerging from dynamic systems of relations that continually re-create shared spaces, 
this concept offers a reminder of the need to practice how we relate to each other across our differences. 

I’ll come back to this notion of building relationships across difference in a bit, but the important point for now is that this process can feel uncomfortable yet offers a pathway to contributing to changing structures by changing ourselves.  

## Swarming on a first house
With commoning in mind, RAD housing seeks to balance the emergent group-project dynamics by creating explicit processes for practicing collective actions that contribute to shard goals. 

One way that the model does this is through the expectation that more people will contribute to acquiring and retrofitting each house than will eventually live in that specific house - this is especially so for the first house of each collective. 

Taking a commoning approach to RAD houses also allows for the possibility that the folk who end up living in each established house are not necessarily those who choose to live there during the retrofit stage. 

For example, if a group of 18 people ‘swarm’ their collective efforts to acquire a 3-bedroom property and retrofit it into one with 8 bedrooms across two dwellings, less than half the group will be housed there once established. 

Given this, the collective needs to have processes for deciding which participants are prioritised as residents when rooms in Established Properties become available should not be tied to financial or labour contributions.

## Multi-house collectives
The good news is that the more participants able to swarm on each house, the sooner the collective is able to afford an additional house to put into the retrofitting and decommodifying pipeline - ensuring that all participants are able to be directly housed eventually.  

Then, by collectively stewarding a range of different retrofitted house configurations across multiple properties, folk can self-organise into compatible co-living arrangements that can be re-considered as housing needs change over time.

In this context, the practice of navigating the emerging relational dynamics is crucial for both within-house collective living, 
and across-property practices for stewarding these houses for broader benefit.

We also recommend capping each collective at a size that supports high-trust relationships while allowing flexibility in living arrangements 
- in this example, it's 43 people across 6 properties / 12 houses.

Once established, collectives could then support emerging projects seeking to retrofit and decommodify more housing.   

## Participating in living collectively
A key aspect of emerging relational dynamics in multi-house collectives are the different decision-making processes needed within and across houses 

The options for how we make decisions together are embedded within the broader governance practices that structure our relationships.
Within colonial contexts, capitalism pressures us to default to ways of relating that perpetuate broader oppressive structures. 
To resist this, we need to get better at exploring, calibrating, and articulating shared expectations around each aspect of participation in collective practices.
 
A key consideration here is that some decisions impact multiple housing sites, while others only impact one property, or a single house, or even one of the various spaces within a house. 

These decisions may also differ depending on the relevant streams within the process of transitioning to stewardship.  
Other factors include how often agreements need to be reviewed to ensure shared expectations can change as new perspectives emerge.

So, instead of prescribing a specific approach to making decisions, RAD housing collectives are expected to co-create their own processes for determining who makes what decisions, when.
